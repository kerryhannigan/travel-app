<h1>Travel Web App</h1>
<Text>This is my personal project and is a work in progress. The web app uses the Priceline** API to retrieve flights based on origin, destination, and budget information obtained from user input. The goal of this project is to learn about web app development, version control, React.js, and project time management.</Text>
